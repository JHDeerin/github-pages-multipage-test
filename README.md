# github-pages-multipage-test

A minimal example to test linking between multiple pages in a GitHub Pages-hosted website: https://jhdeerin.github.io/github-pages-multipage-test/

Built with handcrafted copy-pasted HTML, because if there're 2 things in the whole universe this test isn't meant to be it's:
1.  a templating framework spike
2.  permanent
