<h1>The Hole</h1>
<p>It is your great misfortune to fall into <strong>THE HOLE</strong>. The Hole is very deep. There is no visible light. It is unclear which direction is up. There do not seem to be edges to The Hole.</p>
<p>You don't remember falling. You cannot see the floor, but it must be there, since the falling has stopped.</p>
<p>There is no way out of The Hole<a href="../page2.html">.</a></p>
